  - [ ] Implement ACID transactions for multiple operations
  - [ ] Add rollback functionality on failure
  - [ ] Support atomic updates with "all or nothing" semantics
  - [ ] Add transaction logging for recovery

- **Concurrency Improvements**
  - [ ] Implement fine-grained locking (per-key locks instead of global)
  - [ ] Optimize for high-contention scenarios
  - [ ] Implement lock-free data structures where appropriate

- **Performance Optimizations**
  - [ ] Create benchmarking suite to measure operations/second
  - [ ] Optimize memory usage and allocation patterns
  - [ ] Switch to a more efficient HTTP library (e.g., fasthttp)
  - [ ] Improve JSON serialization/deserialization performance

### 1.2 - Enhanced Functionality

- **TTL (Time-to-Live) Support**
  - [ ] Add expiration time for keys
  - [ ] Implement automatic key eviction based on TTL
  - [ ] Add support for retrieving a key's remaining TTL

- **Data Types**
  - [ ] Extend beyond string values to support:
    - [ ] Integers with atomic increment/decrement
    - [ ] Lists with push/pop operations
    - [ ] Sets with add/remove/intersection operations
    - [ ] Hash maps for nested key-value structures

- **Persistence Options**
  - [ ] Add optional disk persistence
  - [ ] Implement append-only file (AOF) for durability
  - [ ] Add point-in-time snapshots
  - [ ] Support configurable sync intervals

## Version 2.x (Medium Term)

### 2.1 - Scalability & Distribution

- **Clustering Support**
  - [ ] Implement basic clustering with consistent hashing
  - [ ] Add node discovery and automatic rebalancing
  - [ ] Support master-replica replication
  - [ ] Implement consensus algorithm for cluster coordination

- **Sharding**
  - [ ] Implement data partitioning across multiple nodes
  - [ ] Add support for resharding without downtime
  - [ ] Implement smart key routing for efficient operations

- **Multi-DC Support**
  - [ ] Enable geographic distribution of data
  - [ ] Implement conflict resolution strategies
  - [ ] Add latency-aware routing for operations

### 2.2 - Security & Access Control

- **Authentication**
  - [ ] Add username/password authentication
  - [ ] Implement token-based authentication
  - [ ] Support client certificates for mutual TLS

- **Authorization**
  - [ ] Add ACL (Access Control List) support
  - [ ] Implement role-based access control
  - [ ] Support fine-grained permissions per key or key pattern

- **Encryption**
  - [ ] Add TLS support for all client communications
  - [ ] Implement at-rest encryption for persisted data
  - [ ] Add key rotation capabilities

## Version 3.x (Long Term)

### 3.1 - Enterprise Features

- **Advanced Monitoring**
  - [ ] Implement comprehensive metrics system with Prometheus support
  - [ ] Add distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
  - [ ] Create real-time dashboards for monitoring
  - [ ] Implement anomaly detection and alerting

- **Query Language**
  - [ ] Develop a simple query language for advanced data retrieval
  - [ ] Support filtering, sorting, and aggregation
  - [ ] Add support for secondary indexes for efficient queries

- **Pub/Sub Messaging**
  - [ ] Implement publish/subscribe pattern with channels
  - [ ] Support pattern matching for subscriptions
  - [ ] Add message persistence for offline subscribers

### 3.2 - Developer Experience

- **Client Libraries**
  - [ ] Create official client libraries for major languages:
    - [ ] Go, Python, JavaScript, Java, Rust
  - [ ] Add intelligent client-side caching
  - [ ] Implement connection pooling for efficient resource usage

- **Web UI**
  - [ ] Build an administrative web interface
  - [ ] Support visualizations of data distribution
  - [ ] Add monitoring and management capabilities

- **Plugins & Extensions**
  - [ ] Create a plugin system for custom functionality
  - [ ] Support user-defined data types and operations
  - [ ] Add scripting capabilities (e.g., Lua integration)
